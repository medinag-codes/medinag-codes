I'm a former R&D Scientist turned **Full Stack Software Engineer**, blending analytical precision with creative problem-solving. My background in the laboratory sharpened my attention to detail and experimentation ‚Äî skills I now bring to every line of code I write. 

I‚Äôm especially drawn to front-end development, where logic meets aesthetics, and I get to build experiences that are both functional and beautiful. That duality ‚Äî technical and creative ‚Äî is what fuels my love for building intuitive, full-stack applications that make a real impact.
